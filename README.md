Considering our education at Codam, we wanted to look into the differences in education backgrounds among the employees of Mega Inc. We focused on the full stack developers who have less than six years of professional experience and examined whether education background affects the income of employees (converted salary). The results showed that eventough there were more people with a formal education than without, their salary stayed approximately the same. We also found that there was a difference between employees from the US and from the EU. The employees of the US earn 60% more than the employees in the EU. Besides that, we analysed the difference between the income of males, females and others. Overall male employees earn more money than the other two groups. We recommend that the company should implement recruitment criteria that is less based on formal education. Instead they should make use of tests or assignments in order to assess the employees. Furthermore, the company should look into why there is a difference between incomes across countries.
