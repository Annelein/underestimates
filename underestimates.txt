Considering our education at Codam, we wanted to look into the differences in Formal Education types among the emplyees.
Is there a bias in employees who are earning more in combination with their education and amount of years they have been coding for?
We divided them in two sub groups:
- 'Self taught': employees who have a maximum of Secundary school as formal education and more than 5 years of coding experience
- 'System taught': employeed who have more then Secundary school as formal education and less then 5 years of coding experience
The results were suprisingly good: the 'Self taught' group were earning more.
So to us this is very propising: we are going to make a lot of money later on :)
Still a bias was found in the difference between the two groups without looking at their earnings.
There are way more 'System taughts' compared to 'Self taughts'. 
This is something we find to be odd because apperantly the 'Self thaught' are of more value to the company because they earn more.
But still the company is hiring more 'System taughts'.
